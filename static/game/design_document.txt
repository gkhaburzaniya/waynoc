Overview
Three trainable skills: Social, Mental, and Physical.

Core Gameplay Loop
Combat: Sort-of-tower defense. Except the monsters are just chasing you around the map.
Physical skills govern how fast your character moves. Mental how much damage your
magical blast does. Social, how many NPCs help you out.

Progression: Players earn XP through time passing which they can allocate to improve one
of the three skills. Rate of monster appearances goes up with time.

NPCs: Sort of just stand around at the bottom of the map shooting weak magic blasts.
