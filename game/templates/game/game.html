    <p id="bjornaer_description" style="display:none">
      Magi of Bjornaer (BYORE-nayr) concern themselves primarily with beasts
      and the animalistic side of human nature. Because of this emphasis in
      their training, each Bjornaer magus can take the form of an animal,
      known as his "heartbeast." Understanding the heartbeast in particular and
      animals in general is considered more important than Hermetic magic by
      many in this House.
