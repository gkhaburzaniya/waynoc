        <p id="Bjornaer">
            Magi of Bjornaer (BYORE-nayr) concern themselves primarily with beasts and
            the animalistic side of human nature. Because of this emphasis in their
            training, each Bjornaer magus can take the form of an animal, known as his
            "heartbeast." Understanding the heartbeast in particular and animals in
            general is considered more important than Hermetic magic by many in this
            House.
        </p>
        <p id="Bonisagus">
            Bonisagus (BOH-nee-SAH-goos) invented the Hermetic theory of magic, and his
            student, the maga Trianoma, masterminded the formation of the Order. House
            Bonisagus is a true lineage; all of its members can trace their heritage
            back to Bonisagus himself.
        </p>
        <p id="Criamon">
            The very secretive House is known for its obscure philosophy, its disdain
            for simple power, and its members' habit of marking their faces and bodies
            with arcane symbols. Followers of Criamon(KREE-ah-mone) are an enigmatic and
            otherworldly group of magi, generally having little interest in the politics
            of the Order.

            You are particularly adept with one Ability, and add 2 to its value whenever
            you use it. Note that you do not, in general, use an Ability when learning
            it, teaching it, or writing about it.
