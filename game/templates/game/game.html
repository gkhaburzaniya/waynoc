    <p id="bjornaer_description" hidden>
        Magi of Bjornaer (BYORE-nayr) concern themselves primarily with beasts and the
        animalistic side of human nature. Because of this emphasis in their training,
        each Bjornaer magus can take the form of an animal, known as his "heartbeast."
        Understanding the heartbeast in particular and animals in general is considered
        more important than Hermetic magic by many in this House.

    <p id="bonisagus_description" hidden>
        Bonisagus (BOH-nee-SAH-goos) invented the Hermetic theory of magic, and his 
        student, the maga Trianoma, masterminded the formation of the Order. House
        Bonisagus is a true lineage; all of its members can trace their heritage back to
        Bonisagus himself.

    <p id="criamon_description" hidden>
        The very secretive House is known for its obscure philosophy, its disdain for
        simple power, and its members' habit of marking their faces and bodies with
        arcane symbols. Followers of Criamon(KREE-ah-mone) are an enigmatic and
        otherworldly group of magi, generally having little interest in the politics of
        the Order.
    </p>
    <p id="hermetic_magus_description" hidden>

    <p id="puissant_magic_theory_description" hidden>
        You are particularly adept with one Ability, and add 2 to its value whenever you
        use it. Note that you do not, in general, use an Ability when learning it,
        teaching it, or writing about it.
